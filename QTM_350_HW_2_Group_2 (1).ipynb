        "We show how one hot encoding can be done with pandas below. One hot encoding is a powerful tool used to transform a column of categorical values with many labels into columns where each column is a binary value. For example, in the transformation of the Ticket column in the Titanic dataset, we get rid of the Ticket column and add columns where each column title was originally a ticket label in the column. A row contains a 1 if that row originally had that ticket label, and 0 if otherwis. This transformation is useful for training machine learning models that have a difficult time handling categorical data. "
